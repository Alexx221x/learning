    "The doctor has bad news and good news for X. The bad news is that X tested positive for a serious disease, and that the test is 99% accurate (i.e., the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease is 0.99, as is the probability of testing negative given that you donâ€™t have the disease). The good news is that this is a rare disease, striking only one in 10,000 people. Why is it good news that the disease is rare? What are the chances that X actually has the disease?"
